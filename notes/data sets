1. Landsat is over 40 years of data. (available on their website and cloud***)

2. Sentinel-1 is radar images (I think)***

3. Sentinel-2 is multi-spectral satellite imagery (I think)***

4. Modis (available data covers the same geographical location twice a day***)

5. Australian Reflectance Grid (ARG) from the Geoscience Australia. Processed images are called Landsat Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function-Adjusted (NBAR) images (referenced in [3]). The NBAR images also have corresponding "Pixel Quality Maps" available that contain flags to indicate different defects in the images. for example, if a band is saturated, or clouds in images or cloud shadows, topographic shadows etc.

################ 1, 2, 3 and 4 can be downloaded and labelled using open-source QGIS software a. using NDVI and b. using signature-based classification #################

6. Quickbirds dataset (mentioned in [4])

7. World-view mentioned (mentioned in [4])

8. ISPRS dataset for segmentation

9. EuroSat dataset for patch-wise classification (labeled sentinel-2 images from DFKI)
